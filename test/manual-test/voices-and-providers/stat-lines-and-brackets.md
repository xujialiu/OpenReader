# Short lines, brackets and the Fish language hint (#23, #25)

`stat-line-fixture.ts` writes `Stat Line Fixture.epub`: one chapter, no
heading, six paragraphs that are six Utterances — `100 exp`, `2/50 HP`,
`You gained 100 exp.`, `He cast [Fireball] at the wolf.`, `[Level Up]`,
`If x < 5 and y > 3, stop.` Put it in `Documents/Inbox/` and send the harness's
`add`, as for the sized fixtures ([font-size.md](../settings/font-size.md)).

```sh
npx tsx test/manual-test/fixtures/stat-line-fixture.ts /tmp/openreader-stat-lines
```

## What was sent, and where the highlight fell (`stop-on-word.cjs`)

With the fixture open and paused, the simulator silenced, and this worktree's
Metro writing to a file:

```sh
SHOTS_DIR=/tmp/openreader-shots-01 OPENREADER_METRO=http://127.0.0.1:PORT \
  node test/manual-test/voices-and-providers/stop-on-word.cjs SIMULATOR_UDID METRO_LOG Fireball 20
```

It sends the harness's `watchfetch` for `api.fish.audio`, installs a recorder
in the reader's WebView through the harness's `js` (every change of the
`openreader-utterance` and `openreader-word` highlights, every 40 ms), presses
Play through the debugger with an in-app watchdog at MAX_SECONDS, pauses as
soon as the chosen word is the word highlighted, and prints the highlight
changes and the request bodies (never headers). `SHOTS_DIR` also takes
screenshots while it plays. It checks the simulator's own volume first. A
handler probe for Play and Pause, not a touch test; the recorder reads what the
WebView painted.

Measured 2026-09-22 with Dax (`en/9fa4b7a1b67446b48208f2f5d4bcd8da`) and the
default bracket list, 7.12 s from Play to Pause: the request texts were
`[Speak in American English] 2/50 HP`, `[Speak in American English] 100 exp`
(the first two are in flight together, so their order in the log is not the
reading order), `You gained 100 exp.`, `He cast Fireball at the wolf.`,
`[Speak in American English] Level Up`, `If x < 5 and y > 3, stop.`; no
`GET /model/9fa4b7a1…` lookup, because the start-up listing held Dax. Word
highlights: `100`, `exp`; `2`, `50`, `HP`; `You`, `gained`, `100`, `exp`;
`He`, `cast`, `Fireball`, `at`, `the`, `wolf` — each the document's own word,
`Fireball` without its brackets, nothing for the hint. Read-ahead is three
Utterances, so the sixth request goes out while the third line is read. A
download (`BracketsProbe` below) sent the same six texts, in reading order.

If the first line fails with "cannot reach api.fish.audio … The network
connection was lost", see Pitfalls: play again, and do not count that run. The
script does not notice a reading that stopped by itself; it waits out
MAX_SECONDS with nothing playing (the first measured run waited 20 s after
the failure at about 8 s), so keep the cap near what the stop word needs.

## The bracket switch over an open reader, and the download it names (`BracketsProbe.swift`)

```sh
bash test/manual-test/kit/run-probe.sh BracketsProbe SIMULATOR_UDID /tmp/openreader-brackets-01 -only-testing:testDownloadStatLines
```

- `testDownloadStatLines`: a cold launch, the Library's `...`, Download, Select
  all, Download selected, and `1 chapters downloaded` within 90 s. Real Fish
  requests on the free model; no playback.
- `testFlipBracketSwitch`: attaches to the running app, which must already be
  on General. The UI never puts General over an open reader, so push it with
  the harness: `{"do":"go","route":"General"}` while the reader is open. It
  flips "Remove enclosing brackets when reading" once and goes back to the
  paused reader.
- `testReadDownloadCount`: attaches to an open reader and prints the Download
  drawer's count.

Check the offline store between them, read-only, from the host:
`sqlite3 "file:$D/Documents/offline-narration-v2/catalog.sqlite?mode=ro"`
with `SELECT * FROM state` (the `speech` row is the setting the keys answer
to), `SELECT ordinal, clip_key FROM memberships WHERE document=…` and
`SELECT key FROM clips WHERE document=…`. A key is the SHA-256 of the Speech
Text (`offline/catalog-keys.ts`), so it can be computed on the host with
`prepareSpeechText`.

Measured 2026-09-22: the download saved six clips under the Speech Text keys
(`He cast Fireball at the wolf.` as `8773e8c3…`, `Level Up` as `46cc8f36…`).
Switched off by touch: `speech` became `[false]` at once, those two
memberships became `57438442…` and `655001ea…` (the bracketed texts), the other
four stayed, and the drawer said `0 chapters downloaded` with the chapter at
`4 / 6`. Line 4 then went to Fish as `He cast [Fireball] at the wolf.` and the
highlight went `He`, `cast`, `at`, `the`, `wolf`, with nothing for the
swallowed word. Switched back on: `[true,"<> []"]`, the keys back, `1 chapters
downloaded`, and line 4 played from the saved audio with no request, `Fireball`
highlighted.
