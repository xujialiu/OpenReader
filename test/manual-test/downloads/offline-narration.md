# Offline narration and reader actions

With the current Debug app connected to Metro and the fixture Document `A Short Test of Reading Aloud` in the Library:

```sh
bash test/manual-test/kit/run-probe.sh OfflineProbe SIMULATOR_UDID /tmp/openreader-offline-inspect --mode inspect
```

This uses real XCTest touches to check the three-action drawer, font-size stepper, keyboard-visible rename/save and restoration of the fixture's original display name. It then checks persisted download completion, or selects chapters if the fixture has not yet been downloaded. It never presses Play. Review the exported screenshots as well as the assertions.

To exercise management and deletion against an already completed fixture, use `management` instead of `inspect` after making a complete backup of the stopped app's `Documents/offline-narration-v2` directory. The mode uses real XCTest touches to enter Manage downloads, select the first chapter, confirm Delete downloaded audio, and assert that only the second chapter remains with its measured saved size. Stop the app before restoring that same SQLite-format backup, then relaunch it before handing the simulator back; this mode does not prove deletion of a document from the library or playback of the remaining chapter.

To verify display-name persistence across a cold app restart, use `alias` instead of `inspect`. The mode uses real Rename touches, terminates and relaunches OpenReader, checks the alias in Library and Reader, then restores the fixture's original name. It does not prove persistence across an OS reboot or a library file migration.

To exercise real synthesis and persistence, configure a provider in the app and use `download` instead of `inspect`. This selects and downloads the entire short fixture and may spend provider quota; it never downloads the owner's other documents. The fixture has 17 speakable utterances in two chapters. Already completed audio is reused; start this mode with an incomplete fixture if testing the actual Download selected button.

To verify indexed progress for a second voice without provider quota, stop the app's current work first and run the disposable synthetic-fixture mode:

```sh
bash test/manual-test/downloads/second-voice-progress.sh SIMULATOR_UDID /tmp/openreader-second-voice-progress-01
```

The wrapper backs up and restores the complete v2 offline directory, Library and settings, then adds one known shared clip for a synthetic second voice to the short fixture. The XCTest uses real touches to open Download, choose that saved voice and require `0 chapters downloaded` plus `1 / 7` for the second chapter. The synthetic row and copied audio are removed by restoring the backup even when the test fails. This checks indexed SQLite progress and the omitted-text `textCount` display; it does not test provider synthesis or playback.

After the fixture is downloaded, silence the device with `silence.sh set SIMULATOR_UDID`, terminate and relaunch the app with `xcrun simctl` to empty the memory cache, then run:

```sh
node test/manual-test/downloads/offline-playback.cjs SIMULATOR_UDID
```

This reuses `cdp.cjs` to reject all fetches, temporarily disable the fixture's Fish provider, and route every newly created native audio source through a zero-gain node before Play. It checks actual saved-audio decoding, an active native playback queue and word-timing state, then immediately pauses. A five-second app watchdog and host cleanup also pause on failure. It prints the measured duration and network request count, restores settings/fetch, and keeps generated debugger expressions in a temporary directory. The zero-gain route is additional silence protection for the iOS 27 simulator, whose Control Centre had no volume slider; the `0.6` its `outputVolume` reported is the device's own `sim_volume`, which `silence.sh` now sets to zero. This is a handler probe, not a real Play touch, a physical connectivity test or a drift measurement. Restart the app afterwards to remove debugger instrumentation and verify it remains paused.

`OfflineProbe`'s `background` mode presses Home, waits 40 seconds to cover the bounded UIKit background-task window, then returns to the app without playback. Use it with a controlled queued task and observe the persisted task state from the host; the UI test alone proves only that the app can be left and reopened, not that synthesis continued or resumed.
