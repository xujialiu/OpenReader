# The reader's sheets, the voice handover and the Fish picker (`ReaderProbe.swift`, `voice-playback.cjs`)

## The reader's sheets and the voice handover (`ReaderProbe.swift`, `voice-playback.cjs`)

With the latest Debug app connected to Metro and the existing fixture Document
`A Short Test of Reading Aloud` in the Library:

```sh
bash test/manual-test/kit/run-probe.sh ReaderProbe SIMULATOR_UDID /tmp/openreader-reader-01
```

This reuses the disposable XCTest project builder. It opens the Document if
needed, drags all four handles/title regions, checks that Voice and Speed have
no Done button, and checks a paused voice choice stays open when the fixture's
Sarah/Adrian rows are present. It never presses Play. Inspect exported screenshots
as well as assertions. It leaves the reader paused. The optional voice choice
check restores Sarah; use this on the fixture document, not the owner's reading.

For deterministic transport/handover checks, first silence the simulator with
`silence.sh set`, open the fixture Document, and open Voice once so its Fish list is loaded. Fish
must already be enabled with its key in the app. No credential is read by or
printed from the test script. The first eight list entries supply distinct
choices; an English fixture supplies the test text.

```sh
node test/manual-test/voices-and-providers/voice-playback.cjs SIMULATOR_UDID /tmp/openreader-reader-01
node test/manual-test/voices-and-providers/voice-playback.cjs SIMULATOR_UDID /tmp/openreader-touch-01 touch
```

The first command requires an existing screenshot directory. It replaces only
Fish synthesis responses in the running process with delayed silent WAVs and
word timestamps. The actual provider parser, native audio graph, reader clock,
React handlers and persistence callbacks run. Assertions cover initial loading,
pause before receipt without abort, same-Utterance word handover, latest choice
wins, failure rollback, next-Utterance fallback without timings, and pausing a
pending handover until the next Play. Each playback interval stops on its checked
transition, with an eight-second watchdog. It reports durations in milliseconds.
This is a handler probe, not a touch test or a test of live provider audio quality.

The `touch` command uses a **new** artifact directory. It installs a five-second
reply delay and runs `ReaderProbe` in its `loading` mode to press Play, inspect the
spinner, and physically tap it to pause before any reply arrives. It then checks
that audio still arrives and the app remains paused. Do not run loading mode by
itself: it depends on the fixture and watchdog installed by the outer script.

Both modes restore fetch, the original voice and speed, close the sheet and
pause in `finally`. They use Metro's existing CDP inspection approach; they add
no test hooks to production app code. Do not edit app code while a probe runs:
Fast Refresh can replace the state being inspected. Restart the app afterwards
to remove all temporary debugger globals and verify final delivery separately.

## Paused sentence seeking after background receipt

With the same silenced simulator, fixture Document and loaded Fish list as above:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/openreader-paused-seek-01
node test/manual-test/voices-and-providers/voice-playback.cjs SIMULATOR_UDID /tmp/openreader-paused-seek-01 paused-seek
```

This mode pauses before the delayed silent audio arrives, waits for the native
queue, then sends text-tap messages for the current and next sentences through
the real reader bridge. It samples the actual WebView CSS highlights across two
300 ms fixture-word intervals: the sentence must remain highlighted with no word
range. Each Play must then highlight the selected sentence's first word, and
playback stops immediately after that observation, with the existing watchdog
and cleanup paths as backup. Screenshots are saved for both paused selections.

The temporary diagnostic receiver survives React updates and consumes only the
probe's responses; other renderer errors keep their normal reporting path.
Restart the app afterwards to discard all debugger state. This is a bridge-message
probe, not a physical touch test, live-provider audio test or long-term drift test.

## Fish regional picker, actual simulator touch

With Fish enabled and the fixture Document open, this opens Voice, physically
taps `en-IN` and asserts that `Aarav — Male Indian multilingual (EN)` appears:

```sh
bash test/manual-test/kit/run-probe.sh ReaderProbe SIMULATOR_UDID /tmp/openreader-fish-picker-01 --mode fish
```

It uses the live voice list, so it needs the configured app key and network.
It does not select a voice or start playback. It leaves the picker open and
captures the list for visual review. The source-toggle combinations are covered
by the provider tests; this mode verifies regional navigation and visibility.
