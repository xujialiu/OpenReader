# Two fingers: Files' own selection, and the download drawer's copy (#57)

`TwoFingerProbe.swift` makes two-finger drags (see **Pitfalls › XCTest**) and
`two-finger.sh` runs it. Files first needs rows to sweep: launch Files once on
the device, then

```sh
bash test/manual-test/downloads/two-finger.sh SIMULATOR_UDID stage   # 60 files in On My iPhone › Rows
bash test/manual-test/downloads/two-finger.sh SIMULATOR_UDID /tmp/openreader-two-finger-01 \
  -only-testing:TwoFingerProbe/testFilesBackTowardStart
```

The `testFiles…` methods are the measurements of ADR 0045 (notes 2026-09-24,
02:23 to 03:13); each opens Files afresh on `Rows`, switches the folder from
icons to a list through `More` › `List` if it is showing icons, sweeps, and
prints a `MEASURE` line with the rows Files reports selected (`isSelected`) and
the first row fully in view, which says how far the list scrolled (64 pt a
row). `testFilesEdgeTrembling` holds the fingers with a 1.5 pt tremble: a
perfectly still synthesized hold sometimes stopped Files scrolling at all,
which a real finger does not do. A quick start (19.2 pt every 60 ms) begins
Files' run a row late, because its recogniser fires 26–38 pt after the fingers
come down; move slower when the first row matters.

The `testDrawer…` methods need OpenReader already on a reader whose drawer has
a long list — a part from `~/Works/epub_books` (**Real books** in [../README.md](../README.md)) shows the edge
scrolling; `Shadow Slave 1-250` gives 256 rows — and they `activate` the app
rather than relaunch it, so a worktree's device stays on its Metro (launch it
with `-RCT_jsLocation localhost:PORT` from the host first). Each opens the
Download drawer afresh. `testDrawerSweeps` prints `DRAWER` lines with the
`Download selected (N)` count after each sweep: measured 2026-09-24 at 03:04, 4
for the first row to the fourth, 2 after a sweep that begins on a selected row
goes to the fourth and back to the second, 4 when one finger carries on alone,
26 after a hold past the list's bottom edge for 1 s (Chapters 16–20 then in
view), and unchanged after a one-finger drag. `testDrawerOneFingerNeverChooses`
compares `swipeUp()` with a synthesized drag (**Pitfalls › XCTest**): measured
again 2026-09-24 verifying #56/#57 together, 4 of 6 `swipeUp()`/`swipeDown()`
changed the count and 0 of 6 synthesized drags did.

Added 2026-09-24, same file: `testDrawerTopEdge` scrolls down first with a
synthesized one-finger drag, then holds at the *top* edge and requires the
shown rows to change (measured: Chapter 25–29 back up to Chapter 2–6, 29
chosen). `testDrawerLongStretchSmoothness` holds at the bottom edge for 3 s —
not longer; see **Pitfalls › XCTest** for why — and requires the shown rows to
differ from before the hold (measured: Part 1 to Chapter 72–76, 81 chosen,
`chosen` climbing 5 → 28 → 50 → 74 across a `recordVideo` capture's frames a
second apart, no stall or drop). `testDrawerOneFingerTapToggles` confirms a
plain one-finger tap still selects, then deselects, a row (via `chosenCount()`,
not `.isSelected` — **Pitfalls › XCTest**). `testDrawerCheckedRowsUnaffectedBySweep`
and `testDrawerManageSweepSelectsForDelete` need the short fixture already
downloaded (run right after `DownloadRingProbe`'s `testDownloadRingLifecycle`,
while its reader is still the active one `openDrawer` reuses): a sweep across
downloaded rows chooses nothing, and a sweep across saved rows in Manage
downloads chooses them for `Delete selected (N)`, which the method then
actually taps through — fine for this fixture, never the owner's.

What it cannot establish: that a real hand does the same — a real finger
trembles, flicks and lands 20–40 pt apart, where these are two exact paths 36 pt
apart; Files' top edge band (a hold over its search field could not be read
back); how the drawer behaves past a 3 s hold, given the synthesis limit above;
and a collapsed volume's sweep behaviour on a device, since no book in
`~/Works/epub_books` has a nested contents list to sweep (checked 2026-09-24:
every part's `toc.ncx` is one flat level) — `range-selection.test.ts` is the
only coverage of that rule.
